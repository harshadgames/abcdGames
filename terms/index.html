                <p>
                  These “Terms of Service” apply to the abcdgames.tech website (“ABCDgames”) as well as any mobile, software application, or online services that are owned and controlled by ABCDgames (collectively, the “Platform”).

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM.

                <br />
                <h5>NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE</h5>
                <p>
                  As a condition of your use of the Platform, you warrant that you will not use the Platform for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices. You may not use the Platform in any manner which could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Platform or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Platform. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided through the Platform.
                </p>
                <br />

                  <li>Engage in any other conduct which, in ABCDgames’s sole discretion, is considered inappropriate, unauthorized, or objectionable.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <h5>WEBSITE CONTENT</h5>
                <p>
                  You may not download, copy, reproduce, change, distribute, or create derivative works of our content without written permission from ABCDgames. The content on the Platform may only be displayed from within our website. You may not display our content in iFrames.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>SERVICE FEES</h5>
                <p>
                  The Platform may be used free of charge or on a subscription basis. We may charge periodic fees to subscribers, which may include benefits like ad-free use of the Platform or access to exclusive content. If you subscribe to the Platform, you will be subject to our Payment Terms. We offer various subscription plans as described on the Platform, some of which automatically renew at the conclusion of each subscription period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you subscribe to such a plan, your subscription will automatically renew and your payment card will be charged each billing period unless and until you cancel your subscription in accordance with the Payment Terms or we terminate your use of the Platform (as described in the “Termination” section below).
                </p>
                <p>
                  All subscription fees are non-refundable. You may cancel your subscription or terminate your use of the Platform at any time, but you will not receive a refund or credit for any fees previously paid. ABCDgames reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change the applicable fees and modify the Payment Terms from time to time.
                </p>
                <br />

These features are limited to adult users. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to participate in certain features of the Platform or access certain content.

                  If you register with us, you agree not to sell, transfer, or assign your membership or any membership rights. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer (or other device, as applicable) so that others may not access the password-protected portion of the Platform using your login information. ABCDgames reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to terminate your account or otherwise deny you access without notice.
                </p>
                <br />

                  ABCDgames grants you the revocable permission to link to the Platform; provided, however, that any link to the Platform: (a) must not frame or create a browser or border environment around any of the content on the Platform or otherwise mirror any part of the Platform; (b) must not imply that ABCDgames or the Platform is endorsing or sponsoring any third party or its products or services, unless ABCDgames has given the third party its prior written consent; (c) must not present false information about, or disparage, tarnish, or otherwise, in ABCDgames’s sole opinion, harm ABCDgames or its products or services; (d) must not use any ABCDgames’s trademarks without the prior written permission from ABCDgames; (e) must not contain content that could be construed as distasteful, offensive or controversial or otherwise objectionable (in ABCDgames’s sole opinion); and (f) must be owned and controlled by you or the person or entity placing the link, or otherwise permit you to enable such link subject to these Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, ABCDgames reserves the right to prohibit linking to the Platform for any reason in our sole and absolute discretion.
                </p>
                <br />

                  ABCDgames reserves the right to terminate your access to and use of the Platform at its sole discretion, without notice, including, without limitation, if ABCDgames believes your conduct fails to conform with these Terms of Service (or any Additional Terms such as the Payment Terms). ABCDgames also reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms of Service. Any violation of these Terms of Service may be referred to law enforcement authorities.
